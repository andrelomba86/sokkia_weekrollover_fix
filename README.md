# Sokkia Week Rollover Fix

This project fixes RINEX files generated by SOKKIA Stratus affected by the GPS week rollover, using the `gfzrnx` utility and a simple Python graphical interface.

## Features

- Renames files according to the RINEX standard.
- Compresses corrected RINEX files into a ZIP archive.
- User-friendly graphical interface (Tkinter).
- Supports logs and station configuration.

## Requirements
